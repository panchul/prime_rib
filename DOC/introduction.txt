Prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.


BRUITE FORCE

The simpliest algorithm to find if a number N is prime is to check all numbers from 2 to N-1, if the remainder of the division is 0, then we have a divider and N is _not_ a prime.

There are several simple considerations we can take into account and have significant increase in performance.
- We do not need to check every number, we can skip all the even numbers and check if N is divisible by 2.
- Same applies to all the non-prime numbers, we can eliminate all of them.
- We do not have to check the numbers all the way to N-1, we only need to test up to square root of N.

So, this bruite force algorithm becomes:

Loop: Iterate from 2 to sqrt(N)
  Step 1: Take next prime number
  Step 2: Check if it divides N.
  Step 3: If it does not divides N, save it
Repeat
